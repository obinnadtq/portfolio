    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Software Developer currently doing an Internship at DNV GL. I am also doing a Masters Degree in Communications Engineering at
      the University of Rostock, Germany. I am passionate about building applications that can help solve Indutry problems and add value to
      the Developer communities. I also love music, so when I am not programming, I am listening to music or playing the drums.
